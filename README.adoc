FeatureHub is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features, from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration.
It's an essential ingredient for enabling the feedback loop and feature testing and experimentation in production with real users.

== Versions

The master branch on this repository always reflects the functional master branch on the main `featurehub` repository.
As such, if you are running against version (say) `0.0.7` of our Docker images, then you should download the
0.0.7+ of the https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-examples/tags[examples].

== The SDK Examples

The SDK Examples consist of two variants

- link:golang-service/README.md[Golang service example]
- link:todo-backend-java/README{outfilesuffix}[Java backend server]
- link:todo-backend-typescript/README{outfilesuffix}[Typescript backend server]
- link:todo-frontend-react-typescript/README{outfilesuffix}[React app]
- link:todo-frontend-react-typescript-feature-override/README{outfilesuffix}[React app with features overrides]
