FeatureHub is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features, from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or centralised configuration.
It's an essential ingredient for enabling the feedback loop and feature testing and experimentation in production with real users.

== Examples
The SDK Examples consist of two variants

- link:todo-backend-java/README{outfilesuffix}[Java backend server]
- link:todo-backend-typescript/README{outfilesuffix}[Typescript backend server]

Both of these will work for the link:todo-frontend-react-typescript/README{outfilesuffix}[React frontend] (which also uses features).


== Running from the Docker image

The examples are available in nodejs form, which makes it easier to explore.

Please see our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRVqXJmbvTk[Youtube Video] for details on how to run these in the Docker images.
