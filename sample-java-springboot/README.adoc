= A FeatureHub SpringBoot Template

This  example simply follows the basics of how a Spring or SpringBoot
application would be provided for in Java. Java server applications
recommend that you expose a health check endpoint, and if you wish
to have your server not get traffic routed to it by your Application
Load Balanccer (or whatever your Cloud provider uses), then simply
fail the health check when FeatureHub is not "ready".

This example is primarily here to provide documentation for the SDK,
but it operates on its own. You must provide two environment variables
for it to start.

[source,bash]
----
export FEATUREHUB_EDGE_URL=http://localhost:8903/
export FEATUREHUB_API_KEY=default/3f7a1a34-642b-4054-a82f-1ca2d14633ed/aH0l9TDXzauYq6rKQzVUPwbzmzGRqe*oPqyYqhUlVC50RxAzSmx
----

It recognizes a "Authorization" header which contains the value it will
directly put into the userKey for simplicity to allow you to try out
percentage rollouts and tagging feature values to users.

The urls are:

-  / - it print Hello World and the value of the SUBMIT_COLOR_BUTTON
- /health/liveness - whether the application is ready to receive traffic

----
curl  -H 'Authorization: richard'  http://localhost:8080
Hello World green1

curl  -H 'Authorization: irina'  http://localhost:8080
Hello World blue
