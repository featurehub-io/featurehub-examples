= The Simple Quarkus Example

This  example simply follows the basics of how a Quarkus
application could be wired for in Java. Java server applications
recommend that you expose a health check endpoint, and if you wish
to have your server not get traffic routed to it by your Application
Load Balanccer (or whatever your Cloud provider uses), then simply
fail the health check when FeatureHub is not "ready".

This example is primarily here to provide documentation for the SDK,
but it operates on its own. You must modify the application.properties file for your instance
of FeatureHub

[source,properties]
----
feature-hub.api-key=default/82afd7ae-e7de-4567-817b-dd684315adf7/SHxmTA83AJupii4TsIciWvhaQYBIq2*JxIKxiUoswZPmLQAIIWN
feature-hub.url=http://localhost:8903

It recognizes a "Authorization" header (via the AuthFilter) which contains the value it will
directly put into the userKey for simplicity to allow you to try out
percentage rollouts and tagging feature values to users.

The urls are:

-  / - it print Hello World and the value of the SUBMIT_COLOR_BUTTON
- /health/liveness - whether the application is ready to receive traffic

----
curl  -H 'Authorization: richard'  http://localhost:8080
Hello World green1

curl  -H 'Authorization: irina'  http://localhost:8080
Hello World blue
