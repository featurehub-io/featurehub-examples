== Description
Backend Todo server app to demonstrate the usage of FeatureHub JavaScript/Typescript SDK with Typescript and restify.

Typescript and restify are used here as an example and can be replaced with any other npm module to perform REST requests and used with Javascript instead.

Demonstrates the Feature Flag ("BOOLEAN" type)

Feature key: "FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE"

If "FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE" is enabled - it will convert todo 'title' property to uppercase for every todo in the response for add/list/delete/resolve operations.

If this feature is disabled it will have todo 'title' in whatever format it was sent when a todo was created.

Uses the `client-typescript-eventsource` library.

The app is based on the Open API description stored in todo-api folder, however Open API code generators are not used in this case

In addition, it demonstrates integration with Google Analytics.

== Prerequisites

* Node @12 or higher

* You need to setup a feature of type "Feature flag - boolean" in the FeatureHub Admin Console.
Set feature key to "FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE".

* You are required to have a Service Account created in the FeatureHub Admin Console with the "read" permissions for your desired environment.
Once this is set, copy the SDK URL from the Service Accounts page for your desired environment and set it as an environment variable:

You need to append at the front of it the edge url and it's port, like this `'http://[featurehub-edge-url]:[featurehub-edge-port]/features/[copied-sdk-url]`

For example: `http://your-server:8553/features/default/4e439d38-1e87-4e77-84c3-2a32c112cfc5/Fpy5YpEfTeR5yQ15DUWEyvpQyfpjKHefMq9QhlodNzN8XH4by048X9Vjlj94fPieNc5nkagdfVoeAJxM`

Note, the port will depend on which FeatureHub installation you are running.
If you are running SSE by itself, or the Docker with "all-separate-postgres" it will default to 8553. If you are running Party Server, it will be 8903, if you are running Docker with All-In-One-h2 it will be 8085

Set SDK Url as your env variable, e.g by running this command:

`export FEATUREHUB_APP_ENV_URL=http://your-server:8553/features/default/4e439d38-1e87-4e77-84c3-2a32c112cfc5/Fpy5YpEfTeR5yQ15DUWEyvpQyfpjKHefMq9QhlodNzN8XH4by048X9Vjlj94fPieNc5nkagdfVoeAJxM`

Alternatively, you can set it in the ```run.sh``` file and run this script to kick off the back-end server.

* If you like to see events fire in your Google Analytics, you will require to have valid GA Tracking ID, e.g. 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X'.

You also need to specify a CID - a customer id this is associate with GA. In this example it is set to a random number.

Read more about CID https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14227331/what-is-the-client-id-when-sending-tracking-data-to-google-analytics-via-the-mea[here]

GA events:

`name: "todo-add", value: "10"`

`name: "todo-delete", value: "5"`

Once you launch the server, any call to "add" or "delete" to-do will generate a GA event accordingly.

More on GA integration can be found here https://docs.featurehub.io/analytics.html

== Installation Instructions

----
npm install && npm run-script start
----

You should see `"Features are available, starting server..."` message in the console. If no message shows up, it is likely the SDK Url is incorrect.

once the app is running, you should be able to do:

[source]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://0.0.0.0:8099/todo/add \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title": "Hello World", "id": "456"}'
----

and to get the list of to-dos:

[source]
----
curl -X GET \
http://0.0.0.0:8099/todo/list \
-H 'Postman-Token: 6bfe318a-5481-4e8e-a3e4-ab881202ba31' \
-H 'cache-control: no-cache'
----

Watch how "title" value in the response changes from lower case to upper case when you turn feature on/off from the FeatureHub Admin Console
